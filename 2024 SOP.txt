Hero, Sentry and wheel leg
1. Check the 3 LEDs in gimbal and 3 LED in chassis -> connector not connect or the referee system cut the channel because of super high power -> Check if short and the wire
	Reconnect (in 1 min)
	If the boards strange(DMM said not connect or the short inside boards), Change the slipring boards (in 5 mins)
	Remove the short channel (no estimation time)
2. Check the LED in the center boards (If one side of chassis not work, check this first) -> Connector broken
	If the SMT connector(for CAN) broken (pull the wire gently), use another one (! before the competition, make sure we have window for change) (in 2 mins)
	If the wire broken, use another one (in 2 mins)
	If the motor broken, change robot
3. Check the LED in the motor -> the CAN not work
4. Check if the CAN wire and connector broken (cut off or broken or connector broken)
	Before competition, make sure all connector work, so we have backup.
5. Check if the CAN reverse (double check with the table)
	Prepare the AUX boards
6. Check if the UART reverse (the number of reverse connector should be odd)
	Prepare the AUX boards

Balance and sentry
1. We can use black center boards to check the power

Super capacitor
1. Before competition, make sure the Machine Spirit LED is on
2. At 3 mins, check it is not on fault
3. At 3 mins, check the temperature of the MOSFET
4. At 3 mins, check the red LED flashing
5. Connect in order!:
